## As a bootcamp student facing to learn coding was over whelming so I decided to create an intercative webpage to store and access easily all the topics and topics and note from my prework course. By building this project ive learned the baisc pilat of HTMl, CSS and Javascript. I have also learned about Git and version control. I used the command lines to navigate the folderes on my maschine and learned the "Push" and "Pull" features.
