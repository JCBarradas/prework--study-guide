# Prework Study Guide Wepage

## Description
As a bootcamp student, learning coding was overwhelming so I decided to create an interactive webpage to store and access easily all the topics and topics and notes from my prework course. By building this project I've learned the basic pillars of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have also learned about Git and version control. I used the command lines to navigate the folders on my machine and learned the "Push" and "Pull" features.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you simply review each section's content. and if you want to interact with the page you can open the Chrom DevTools by pressing (Cmd+optio+I) to see the Javascript code run. Every time you refresh the age you should get a random Topic suggestion for you to study.
Have fun!
